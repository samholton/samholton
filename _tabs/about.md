I am a Systems Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer by day and homelab / tinkerer by night.

Professionally, I aim to provide robust and cost effective solutions to complex problems by weighing the benefit of managed services vs. self hosted or home-brewed options.

In the Homelab my motto is DIY, self hosted, and hands on. I'm always looking to understand how things work, how I can modify them, and how they can work better. I prefer to do things the hard way to learn the details and intricacies of technology without the constraints of a corporate timeline.

This site contains notes, thoughts, and struggles on the following topis:

* Homelab
    * Proxmox
    * TrueNAS Scale
    * Kubernetes
    * OPNsense
    * Networking
* Self hosting
    * Vaultwarden
    * Nextcloud
* 3D Printing
* Homeassistant and home automation
