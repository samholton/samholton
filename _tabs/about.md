I am a Systems Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer by day and homelab / tinkerer by night. DIY, self hosted, and hands on is my motto. I'm always looking to understand how things work, how I can modify them, and how they can work better.

This site contains notes, thoughts, and struggles on the following topis:

* Homelab
    * Proxmox
    * TrueNAS Scale
    * Kubernetes
    * OPNsense
    * Networking
* Self hosting
    * Vaultwarden
    * Nextcloud
* 3D Printing
* Homeassistant and home automation
